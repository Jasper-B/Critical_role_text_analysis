# Critical_role_text_analysis

Hello, in this repository I will share my analysis on the online Dungeons and Dragons game show "Critical Role". This is a weekly stream where voice actors play this game and stream this to a large audience. I started this project because my wife is a very big fan of this show, and this would be a nice example to try some more text analysis.

In this project I wanted to analyse the most frequent words spoken by each player and use this for a deep learning model to predict whether the dungeon master is speaking or a player. For this, I scraped the video subtitles of campaign 2: The Mighty Nein from youtube. These subtitles are manually curated so the data should be very accurate.
